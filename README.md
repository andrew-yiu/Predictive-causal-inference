# Predictive causal inference

This repository contains R code for running the methods in the paper "Causal predictive inference and target trial emulation" by Andrew Yiu, Edwin Fong, Stephen Walker, and Chris Holmes. The preprint can be found here.

The procedures use the **bartMachine** R package, which requires Java. Instructions for installing **bartMachine** can be found [here](https://github.com/kapelner/bartMachine).
